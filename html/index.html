                <p>Not every 0000 is good for every company, and not every company needs or can handle an 0000. Every organization is unique, so we assess your organization on a deeper level to understand
                    its capacity and maturity to implement and sustain technological change. Organizational maturity to invest on technology, and organizational culture to be receptive of change, are some of
                    the key factors to formulate a best-t technology roadmap. Miscalculations lead to choices that create more problems than they solve. We conduct a 0000 readiness assessment and provide
                    
                    you with insights on what problems lie ahead on the path to an 0000 implementation, and what actions can be taken to improve chances of a successful implementation.
                    
                    There are many 0000 , some sector-specic, some too versatile and customizable, some expensive, some easier to use, some cost less to buy but cost more to sustain. Each 0000 has character-
                    istics that make it suitable or unsuitable for an organization, and can induce specic demands on the organization. We conduct process mapping, analyze business goals, and organizational
                    
                    culture, to assess t of 0000 systems to the unique organizational makeup of your people, processes, and technology, enabling you to select a 0000 relatively better suited for your business.</p>
